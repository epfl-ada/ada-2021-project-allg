# Evolution of the place of women’s voices in the media
ada-2021-project-allg created by GitHub Classroom


Abstract  (150 words):

24% of the news sources -people quoted, heard, seen- are women, according to a 2015 study by the Global Media Monitoring Project (1).
The Me too movement started to spread in 2017 after the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. This movement led to a raise of women’s voices everywhere.
The goal of this project is to track the evolution of the place of women’s voices in the medias following the Me too movement, to see if a major feminist movement like this one has led to an increase in the number of women quoted. We can then see if women are underrepresented in the medias and if they are only quoted on certain subjects. We can also check the occupation, the ethnicity and the age of the women that the media highlight to find which social backgrounds are best represented.

##Assistant comment : Make sure to account for the fact that in many fields there is an imbalance between men and women (e.g., in many parliaments). But this should be less of a problem when looking at relative changes.

Research questions : Are women more quoted in the media since the Me too movement ? Are they only quoted on certain subjects (eg. Feminism) ? Women of which social backgrounds, ethnicity and age are best represented in the media ?

Additional database? : number of women in different fields to take into account the imbalance between men and women if there is any ----> find a database
 
Methods : The Wikidata IDs of the speakers in the database will be used to find the speaker’s gender and see if the number of quotations from women has increased. These IDs will also be used to find the ethnicity and the age of the quoted women.
