# Evolution of the place of women’s voices in the media
ada-2021-project-allg created by GitHub Classroom


Abstract  (150 words): ##add some context 
Our idea is track the evolution of the place of women’s voices in the medias following major events like the Me too movement which started in 2017. Using the Wikidata IDs of the speakers in the database, we would find the speaker’s gender and see if the number of quotations from women has increased. We can then see if women are underrepresented in the medias and if they are only quoted on certain subjects. We can also check the occupation of the women that the media highlight to find which social backgrounds are best represented. Also the ethnicity and age ?

##Assistant comment : Make sure to account for the fact that in many fields there is an imbalance between men and women (e.g., in many parliaments). But this should be less of a problem when looking at relative changes.

Research questions : Are women more quoted in the media since the Me too movement ? Are they only quoted on certain subjects (eg. Feminism) ? Women of which social backgrounds, ethnicity and age are best represented in the media ?

Additional database? : number of women in different fields to take into account the imbalance between men and women if there is any ----> find a database
